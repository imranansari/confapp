This workshop will offer you practical guidance to confront the myriad of challenges posed by cloud computing, new models for technology consumption, and infrastructure convergence. Different approaches to service development and design, as well as service management are now accelerated by automation and nimble business execution. These tectonic shifts are altering the mission, the structure, and the very spirit of IT. The skills must change because old ways no longer work and different incentives are paving the way for these new skills. Many lament the death of IT, but BT will continue to be a remarkably rewarding career for those who embrace change. The culture of geeks need not change, but the culture will change nonetheless. True geeks have a wonderful future. Geek imposters do not. Don’t be content to merely survive. Strive to thrive! <hr> <br> <b>From IT to Business Technology (BT) — What Does This Mean to You?</b><br> <i>Bobby Cameron, Vice President, Principal Analyst</i> <br> Location : Grandview A, 2nd Floor <br><br> With technology-defining decisions increasingly made outside of IT’s direct control, what are you supposed to do? Empowered employees bring their own technology to work to better respond to empowered customers; business users configure business processes in SAP and IT-provided BPM tools; and sales and marketing organizations choose online services from vendors like Salesforce.com. This relentless revolution to Business Technology (BT) is redefining technology management. Instead of aligned-IT’s traditional role of managing everything technological, empowered BT organizations expand their role to enable the success of the business users who increasingly manage technology-based business capabilities directly. The BT trend is extending technology management processes beyond the IT organization, like business analysis, project management, and business architecture, requiring that IT organizations empower these business users to successfully take action on their own. IT has to orchestrate services sourced both internally and externally — even as IT continues to deliver and operate systems aligned with the business’ strategies. <hr> <br>  <b>Linking Strategy to Governance — How IT Vendor Management Can Face the Future </b><br> <i>Lutz Peichert, Vice President, Principal Analyst, and Joe Clark, Bulldog Consulting</i> <br> Location : Beaumont Room, 2nd Floor <br><br> This workshop will present IT Vendor Management in a new light. As the landscape of vendors becomes increasingly larger and more complex, new skills and capabilities will be needed for the effective management of key vendor relationships. This interactive workshop will focus on the four key areas of vendor management: relationship management, performance management, contract management and financial management. The workshop will also share examples of how leading companies have applied strong vendor management techniques to revolutionize their traditional sourcing and innovation practices. We’ll highlight how Lincoln can apply the new governance models that leading companies are using to balance business value, costs and risks in IT vendor relationships. Lutz Peichert, Vice President, Principal Analyst, Forrester Research, and a leading expert in sourcing and vendor management, will lead this session.  <hr> <br> <b>Consumerization in the Era of the Extended Enterprise: A Security Point of View </b><br> <i>Chenxi Wang, Vice President, Principal Analyst</i> <br> Location : Provencial Room, 2nd Floor <br><br> In today’s dynamic business environment, IT security needs to move faster. The business, economic and operational benefits of consumer technologies, such as social, mobile, and cloud, are simply too compelling for security to keep being the nay-sayer. The new role of security is to: 1) extend the security perimeter out to individual user and the data they access; 2) give business managers the tools to understand, assess, and manage the risk associated with emerging technologies; 3) educate employees on the risks and responsibilities of consumerization; and 4) deploy focused security products as necessary to attain assurance. Sessions will be structured in an interactive presentation format which encourages active participation and opportunities to learn practical Lincoln Financial applications of topics covered.​​​​​​​​​",
